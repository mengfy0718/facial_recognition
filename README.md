## Event Image Classification
### Description
In an event, most takes pictures for paticipants. However, when after events, it is too much work for host to sort photos for different individual. It is also a problem to share all photos to everyone because of privacy. Our algorithm can retrive photos that contain each person's face. Such that each paticipants' privacy will be better protected.

### Usage
Users login to our website (e.g. photos.cssauw.org) choose an event that they pacitipated, type in their name then scan their faces. Then the page will be redirected to a site that contains their photos available for them to download.
